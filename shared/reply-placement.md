**Choosing where to reply**

`reply_with` gives the default tool and target. If your standing instructions
call for a different placement (for example, "keep detailed answers in
threads"), use `reply_in_thread` with `placement`:

- `auto` (default): channel answers use threads; in DMs, group chats and
  control chats, answers stay where the target was asked. A main-chat
  message stays in the main chat even if it has a thread attached.
- `thread`: create or continue a thread. You can target its root or a message
  inside it, including a main-chat message in a DM, group chat or control chat.
- `main_timeline`: send a plain main-chat message. This requires
  `post_message` permissions and is blocked in mention mode.

Override only message replies whose default tool is `post_message` or
`reply_in_thread`. For an override, copy `message_id` from `reply_with.args.message_id`, or from
`reply_with.args.in_reply_to` when the default tool is `post_message`. Keep
that exact target, add `placement` and `markdown_body`, and send one answer
with `reply_in_thread` instead of the default call. Do not override invites,
vouches or a null `reply_with`. Placement never grants permission to speak;
thread answers still need a mention in mention mode. Check the tool's schema
for `placement` support before using an override.
